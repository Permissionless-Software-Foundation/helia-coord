# Memory Usage

This is the same example app as the directory above, but it's been modified to take
periodic memory snapshots and write the memory usage to a JSON file. This is useful
for tracking potential memory leaks by monitoring memory usage over time.

## Usage

Copy the `memory-log-example.json` to a new file called `memory-log.json`

Run this program with:
- `node start-node.js`
