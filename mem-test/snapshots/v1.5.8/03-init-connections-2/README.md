# 03 init connections

This test was run on a Hetzner VM with good internet and lots of memory. This test was re-run because the 04 and 05 tests showed increased
memory usage on the VM vs the home laptop on a poor internet connection.

In this 03 test, the results were the same between the laptop and VM. This gives evidence that the memory issue stems from peer dialing
used in the 04 and 05 tests.
